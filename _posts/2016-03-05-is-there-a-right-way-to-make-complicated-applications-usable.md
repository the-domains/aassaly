# Is there a right way to make complicated applications usable?

Finding the right tool to use for the job isn't always the easiest task. In the digital world this amounts to trying to figure out which piece of software is the right one to use. This answer is typically subjective as every person has different tastes and varying levels of expertise. This is why designing user friendly applications can be very challenging, even for simple applications. By comparing applications with equivalent functionality but with different degrees of user-friendliness I will generalize of a couple of methods developers use to increase the user experience (UX). More specifically I will compare two expert-level applications of equivalent functionality, and two simpler applications of equivalent functionality to extrapolate generalities about user friendliness.

What is it exactly that makes some complicated programs more user friendly than others? That's what I intend to demonstrate using a couple of examples.

## Background Information

It's easier to understand how complicated software can be user friendly when we have a better understanding of User-Centered Design (UCD) and how it's come to be such a critical step in software development. Software usability has seen a shift in recent years towards a more human-centered approach. UCD is not a new, and it's abundant use in today's digital companies was probably best predicted by by R S Nickerson when he said "the need for the future is not so much computer oriented people as for people oriented computers'' in 1969 \[1\]. Having said that 47 years ago (UCD) is not a novel idea, but rather a growing and continually and evolving concept.
![Figure 1. Taken from [2]: "A pictorial summary of some of the fields related to the user. The major fields are shown with solid lines."](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/981c694f93d56cc9381638a6db49e45f415c3cbd.png)

In brief UCD combines aspects from each of these fields: cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, mathematics, computer science, engineering, human factors and ergonomics, socio-technical systems design, scientific management, work, industrial, and occupational psychology, human relations, and organizational behaviour\[2\]. Figure 1 above visually demonstrates how each of these different fields relate to each other. Naturally, it comes as no surprise that advancements in any one of these fields, including technological advancements, could beneficially affect the end-user's experience. This is why UCD has become such a crucial part of developing software.

## Simple-Application: Usability Example

The UX between two functionally equivalent pieces of expert software can greatly differ. My intent is to compare several expert systems to determine if there are any trends which directly affect the UX either in a positive or negative way. Examples will be taken from applications in the following fields: Software Development, Digital Photography, Office Work, and MRI analysis for medical professionals. Before getting to the more complicated examples I'll start with a simple one: OC Transpo's Travel Planner.

OC Transpo recently released their new travel planner. They describe the new planner by saying it "will provide you with some big improvements, compared to the current version" \[3\]. Figure 2 above is a comparison between the two systems. OC Transpo maintains that the core functionality remains the same in that "travel solutions and schedules are identical in all versions of the travel planner"\[3\]. Comparing the two versions it's easy to see why the new travel planner provides a better UX, however it's not as straightforward as it may seem. In addition to providing the same functionality to the end-user the new travel planner also provides the user with a multitude of enhancements including: a full screen google map, and also integrates a new function allowing users to see departure times for all routes at a Transitway station.

The old Travel Planner allows users to plan a trip, but in order to do so the user must know their current address and their destination address. The planner gives the user 6 different ways to enter this information: using an address, an intersection, a landmark, a bus-stop number, a map, or history (previously used queries). My first time using this system was confusing because the form does not provide much useful feedback regarding the advancement from step to step. For example, Figure 3 above demonstrates what happens when a user attempts to specify their beginning address. Notice how immediately upon pressing okay the text-field is emptied, and a very small text label appears under the "From" portion of the progress bar. While this does provide some feedback to the user the change is not evident enough. As a first time user of the system myself I thought that I had to re-enter my address because I didn't even realize that it accepted my original input. It was only after attempting to use the same address again that a warning message appeared to tell me there are no routes that go to/from the same address. Feel free to try this out for yourself.

Another downfall of the old travel planner is that the map is not what the average user has grown accustomed to. Google maps has become the defacto standard for anyone wanting directions these days due to it's cartographic detail and ease-of-use. The way the map in the old travel planner works is demonstrated in Figure 4 above. Each slide of the graphic depicts what happens as the user moves the mouse over a different area of the map.

While the new system is simultaneously aesthetically pleasing and visually informative the new travel planner's website is deceiving. The red-colored menu bar along the top of the new travel planner is not actually part of the new system, but is instead a standard website navigational menu which navigates to other OC Transpo web pages. This was a design decision which the developers thought would positively improve the user experience because it provides answers to commonly asked questions while visually complimenting the travel planner with the company's signature red color.

There is still room for improvement, however, because clicking on one of these menu items actually redirects the browser outside of the travel planner system. A possible solution to make this aspect of the system more user friendly is for each of the menu items to forcefully open their links in new tabs/windows. Another possibility could be to modify 

## Pro-Application: Usability Example

There are many expert-level applications which possess advanced functionalities useful for professionals, but which are also geared towards the average person. A classic example of this is Adobe's entire creative suite available either for purchase or on a subscription basis on their Creative Cloud. These programs are used by professionals to complete extremely advanced tasks such as creating visual effects for movies/photos or designing a video games on a daily basis. The average person, myself included, only ever use a small portion of the tools at their disposal when using expert applications such as these unless we take courses or read instructional material to learn.
